# dotfiles

These are my configuration dotfiles. We need to install [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/manual/). Then,
after cloning, we can just go to the dotfiles folder and run, for example:

```
stow emacs
```

This will create a symlink following the folder structure specified in the emacs folder.
Check [this tutorial](https://alexpearce.me/2016/02/managing-dotfiles-with-stow/) for more advanced usage of Stow.
